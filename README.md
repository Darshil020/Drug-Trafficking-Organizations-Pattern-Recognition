# Drug-Trafficking-Organizations-Pattern-Recognition
In the 1990s New York City police investigated a cocaine crime ring by tapping phone
conversations between suspected members of a gang. We have in this dataset, 28 indi-
viduals who either placed and/or received a call from one of the others in the circle of
dealers. The left most column indicates the person who placed the call, and the col-
umn names indicate the person who was called. Hence, Lorena did not make any calls,
however she received 2 calls from just one person - Kay.

More about this dataset can be found in this paper: \Understanding the structure of
a drug tracking organization: a conversational analysis" by M Natarajan. The dataset
was downloaded from UCINET.
